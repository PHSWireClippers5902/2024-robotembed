# 2024 Crescendo | Robot Embed
A 3D model of the robot used on the website. We're putting the code here for easier access (for Lex - or whoever wants access to it) and to host on our website.

A live version of this is online on [our website.](https://wireclippers.org/robots)
## How to Commit
Due to WordPress limitations (and a few good practices for general web security), we're restricted to the usage of one <script> tag to embed all of our code.

When committing, don't adjust the `<div>` and `<figure>` tags. These are required in order to embed into WordPress without looking weird. 

Thanks to [@pooiod](https://github.com/pooiod) for getting this up and running!
